/****SRVLET******/

We have a package in java called javax.servlet

And this package has interface Servlet  with 5 methods

We have to implemnt this interface and define it in our own class


web.xml file is deployment descriptor


Create servlet using generic servlet

GenericServlet Abstract Class :  implents servlet 

Generic Sevlet have 4 mnethod body and service method is abstract here also

We can extend Servket ands override service method in our own servlet


HttpServlet Class have servlet method body and and calls protocol specific methods like do post do put do delete  (http specific functinaolties are fouind in httpservlet)


LiferCycle of servlet:

1.Sever side program is servleet

2.First time req send then web container will create servlet obj

3.Then obj is initialised using init()
 method ,With the help of overriding method will run

4. then for request to precess service() is run

5. then for n number for requests service sends n number of reponse (multiple threads will be cerated for runnug services)

6. at last destroy() method is cerated

7.getServletInfo() and getServletConfin() non life cycle method



Welcome File and Welcome File List :-

First time request ---- index.html or html.jsp is send in reponse

home.jsp is created on server

if we want by default  we want home.jsp as opening page

for which web.xml file is config file where we cdan configure homepage 

For this welcomefile and welcomefilelist  tags are used


RequestDsipatcher:
